## Project Overview

A small AI gateway that can use GitHub Copilot, the built-in `codex` provider, or configured third-party providers such as DashScope. GitHub Copilot is optional: if no GitHub token is available, the server can still start in provider-only mode as long as at least one enabled provider is configured.

The gateway exposes OpenAI- and Anthropic-compatible APIs from one local endpoint, so tools like [Claude Code](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code/overview), OpenCode, Codex, and OpenAI-compatible clients can share the same local server.

On the GitHub Copilot path, the gateway prefers Copilot's native Anthropic-style Messages API when available, preserving more Claude-native behavior for tool-heavy workflows.

## Important Notes

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Before using, please be aware of the following:**
>
> 1. **Codex configuration:** When using with Codex, add the gateway provider to `~/.codex/config.toml`. See [Codex `config.toml` Reference](codex.md#codex-configtoml-reference).
>
> 2. **Claude Code configuration:** When using with Claude Code, please configure the model ID as `claude-opus-4-8[1m]`. Example claude `settings.json` see [Manual Configuration with `settings.json`](claude-code.md#manual-configuration-with-settingsjson).
>
> 3. **OpenCode configuration:** When using with OpenCode, configure `~/.config/opencode/opencode.json` with `@ai-sdk/anthropic`. See [Using with OpenCode](opencode.md#using-with-opencode).
>
> 4. **Built-in `copilot`, `codex` and third-party providers:** Run `npx @jeffreycao/copilot-api@latest auth` and choose `copilot`, `codex`, `deepseek`, `custom`, or other providers.
>
> 5. **Note:** Before using GitHub Copilot, read the [GitHub Copilot Security Notice](../../../NOTICE.md#github-copilot-security-notice).

## Prerequisites

- Bun (>= 1.2.x)
- Node.js >= 22.13.0 if you plan to run the published CLI with `npx`
- GitHub account with Copilot subscription only if you want to use the GitHub Copilot provider
- An API key or OAuth login for at least one configured provider if you want to run without GitHub Copilot

## Installation

To install dependencies, run:

```sh
bun install
```

## Running from Source

> [!NOTE]
> Building from source with `tsdown@0.23` requires Node.js `^22.18.0 || ^24.11.0 || >=26.0.0`. This is a build-time requirement only; the published CLI supports Node.js >= 22.13.0.

The project can be run from source in several ways:

### Development Mode

```sh
bun run dev start
```

### Production Mode

```sh
bun run start start
```

> The trailing `start` is the CLI subcommand passed to `src/main.ts`, not a typo: `bun run dev start` runs watch mode, `bun run start start` runs production.

## Using with npx

You can run the project directly using npx:

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Token usage storage uses Node's built-in `node:sqlite` module when running with `npx`. It is enabled on Node.js >= 22.13.0, the first release where `node:sqlite` works without `--experimental-sqlite`. On older Node.js versions the CLI still starts, but token usage storage is disabled.
>
> If you want token usage storage without upgrading Node.js, run the published CLI with Bun instead: `bunx --bun @jeffreycao/copilot-api@latest start`.

```sh
npx @jeffreycao/copilot-api@latest start
```

With options:

```sh
npx @jeffreycao/copilot-api@latest auth keys --add your-gateway-api-key
npx @jeffreycao/copilot-api@latest start --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8080
```

Binding to `0.0.0.0` exposes the gateway to the network, so the server requires at least one gateway API key and restricts CORS to same-origin requests.

For authentication or provider configuration only:

```sh
npx @jeffreycao/copilot-api@latest auth
```

To run without GitHub Copilot, configure at least one provider first, then start the server normally:

```sh
npx @jeffreycao/copilot-api@latest auth login --provider dashscope
npx @jeffreycao/copilot-api@latest start
```
