Copilot API is a local AI gateway that connects Claude Code, OpenCode, Codex, and other clients to GitHub Copilot, the built-in Codex provider, and third-party model providers through a unified API.

## Highlights

- **Unified API Gateway**: Serve OpenAI-compatible Chat Completions (`/v1/chat/completions`), the OpenAI Responses API (`/v1/responses`), and Anthropic-compatible Messages (`/v1/messages`) from one local endpoint.
- **Multi-Provider**: Route GitHub Copilot, the built-in `codex` provider, and third-party providers (Kimi, DeepSeek, DashScope, OpenRouter, OpenCode Go, or a custom provider) behind the same gateway. GitHub Copilot is optional — with at least one enabled provider, the server starts in provider-only mode without a GitHub token.
- **Coding Agent Ready**: First-class setups for Claude Code, OpenCode, and Codex, including the interactive `--claude-code` launcher and a merged model catalog for Codex.
- **Streaming & WebSocket**: SSE streaming on all three client-facing protocols. Upstream Copilot Responses traffic selects WebSocket or HTTP from each model's advertised endpoints; streamed Responses traffic for the built-in `codex` provider uses WebSocket by default and uses HTTP when `useResponsesApiWebSocket` is disabled.
- **Desktop App**: Electron GUI with GitHub Copilot sign-in, Codex OAuth, provider configuration, token usage, logs, and one-click start/stop.

## Quick Start

Requires **Node.js >= 22.13.0** (npx) or **Bun >= 1.2.x**. A Copilot subscription is needed only for the GitHub Copilot provider; other configured providers can run independently.

```sh
npx @jeffreycao/copilot-api@latest start
```

The server listens on `http://localhost:4141` by default. Optionally authenticate with GitHub Copilot or configure a third-party provider first:

```sh
npx @jeffreycao/copilot-api@latest auth login
```

Verify the gateway is up:

```sh
curl http://localhost:4141/v1/models
```

> [!NOTE]
> Token usage storage requires Node.js >= 22.13.0 or Bun. See [Using with npx](docs/guides/en/getting-started.md#using-with-npx) for details.

From here, jump to the guide for your client: [Claude Code](docs/guides/en/claude-code.md#using-with-claude-code), [OpenCode](docs/guides/en/opencode.md#using-with-opencode), [Codex](docs/guides/en/codex.md#using-with-codex), or run it with [Docker](docs/guides/en/docker.md#using-with-docker).

## Compatibility

Every client talks to the same local endpoint. The gateway routes each request to GitHub Copilot, the built-in `codex` provider, or a configured third-party provider, translating between protocols when the provider speaks a different one.

**Client / Protocol Matrix**

| Client | Chat Completions | Responses | Anthropic Messages | Recommended |
|---|:---:|:---:|:---:|---|
| Claude Code | — | — | ✅ Native / Adapter | Anthropic Messages |
| OpenCode | ✅ Native | ✅ Native / Adapter | ✅ Native / Adapter via `@ai-sdk/anthropic` | Anthropic Messages |
| Codex | — | ✅ Native / Adapter | — | Responses |
| OpenAI-compatible clients | ✅ Native | ✅ Native / Adapter | — | Chat Completions |
| Anthropic-compatible clients | — | — | ✅ Native / Adapter | Anthropic Messages |

**Providers and protocols.** Protocol support is model-specific. Chat Completions requires a native endpoint, while Responses and Messages can use supported adapters. The built-in `codex` provider uses Responses natively; third-party providers can use `anthropic`, `openai-compatible`, or `openai-responses`, with per-model overrides.

## Desktop App

Prefer a GUI? The Electron desktop app in `desktop/` covers GitHub Copilot sign-in, OpenAI Codex OAuth, and API-key configuration for Kimi, DeepSeek, DashScope, OpenRouter, or a custom provider — with one-click start/stop of the local server, and the local endpoint, auth header, available models, usage, and logs in one window.

Windows x64 (`.exe`), macOS Apple Silicon (`.dmg`), and Linux x64 (`.AppImage`) packages are published in [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/caozhiyuan/copilot-api/releases). See [Electron Desktop App](docs/guides/en/desktop.md#electron-desktop-app) for full setup and advanced configuration.
